Hi, here are some main hints: 

1. You can find the code file in the directory "cypress\e2e\Test\linkScraper.cy.js" 
2. Launch "cypress\e2e\Test\linkScraper.feature" to execute tests
3. You can find the sample output file in the directory "cypress\fixtures\output.json"

P.S. Feel free to reach out if you need any assistance or more information by email "dariaivanovaqa@gmail.com"

Have a great day! =)
